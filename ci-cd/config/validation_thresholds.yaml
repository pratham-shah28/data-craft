# Model Validation Thresholds
# Used by CI/CD pipeline to validate model performance

validation_thresholds:
  performance:
    min_overall_score: 40.0  # Composite score (performance + bias + speed)
    min_success_rate: 50.0    # Percentage of successful query generations
  
  bias:
    max_bias_score: 50.0      # Maximum acceptable bias score (lower is better)
    max_severity: "MEDIUM"     # Options: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
  
  execution:
    min_execution_success_rate: 50.0  # Percentage of queries that execute successfully
    min_result_validity_rate: 50.0    # Percentage of results that are valid
    min_overall_accuracy: 50.0         # Overall accuracy (valid results / total queries)
